# Introduction

This assignment focuses on two different software methodologies: Exploratory and Manual Testing. Exploratory testing focuses on designing test cases as a tester is actively testing the application. They are learning the software as they are writing test cases, and adapting the test cases based on what they find. Manual testing refers to manually executing a set of already thought-out/designed test cases, without using automation tools, ie. a person still needs to execute the test cases.
